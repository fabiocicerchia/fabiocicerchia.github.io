I'm a passionate **Web Developer** with about **10 years** of commercial
experience, I work either on _front-end_ or _back-end_. I also like to work in
such different areas like **SEO**, **Accessibility** and **Project Management**.
I'm looking at any time for new challenges and incentives to keep myself at the
**cutting edge**. **I like to share the knowledge to help everyone whenever
possible**. I like to _spend my spare time to study_ new technologies and
methodologies that might be applied the next day at work.

Since the early 2000s I've been focused to the web development, and nowadays I'm
almost totally involved in **PHP** and **JS** applications. I've obtained
certification as _PHP 5 Engineer_ and _IWA Application Developer_.

In the last years I was committed on two big project, a web portal for a
healthcare company and a real-time statistic system, by these projects I've got
direct experience about **agile development, project management and about
mentoring developers.** I do like **refactoring** (sometimes just to improve
either performance or scalability), **documentation** (not only about code), and
**testing** that are anything but boring.

Lately I've been involved in the learning, either for fun or work of _Node.js_,
_Doctrine 2_, _MongoDB_, _Puppet_, _Redis_, _Symfony 2_, _Vagrant_, _XPath_ and
_Zend Framework_, and I'm going to start with _Arduino_, _Cacti_, _Raspberry Pi_
and _mod_pagespeed_.
