The [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) has the following 4 core
values:

 * _Individuals and interactions over processes and tools_  
   this means **communicate**, a lot.
 * _Working software over comprehensive documentation_  
   if you are working on something that is **not working properly** why bother
   documenting what's doing (and maybe it's even going to change).
   Also the customer will use / buy the software not the documentation.
 * _Customer collaboration over contract negotiation_  
   the requirements cannot be collected at the beginning and **will change**
   during the development cycle, so **continuous feedback** is needed.
 * _Responding to change over following a plan_  
   it doesn't mean **have no plan** at all, it's just about to **being
   flexible**.

The [Anti Agile Manifesto](http://antiagilemanifesto.com/) is telling exactly
what the things really are:

 * Epics are really just projects
 * Stories are really just use cases
 * Sprints are really just work
 * Stand-ups are really just meetings
 * Iterations are really just versions
 * Backlogs are really just to do lists
 * Backlog grooming is really just planning
 * Burn-down charts are really just earned value charts
 * Velocity is really just output
 * And that tasks, in fact, are really just tasks.

The [Minifesto](http://minifesto.org/) has got the following points:

 * Fight for Pareto's law, look for the 20% of effort that will give you the 80%
   of results.
 * Prioritize, minimalism isn't about not doing things but about focusing first
   in the important.
 * Perfect is enemy of good, first do it, then do it right, then do it better.
 * Kill the baby, don't be afraid of starting all over again. Fail soon, learn
   fast.
 * Add value. Think constantly how you can help your team and position yourself
   in that field/skill.
 * Basics, first. Follow always a top-down thinking starting by the
   best-practises of CS.
 * Think different. Simple is harder than complex, which means you'll need to
   use your creativity.
 * Synthesis is the key of communication. We have to write code for humans not
   machines.
 * Keep it plain. Try to keep your designs with few layers of indirection.
 * Clean kipple and redundancy. Minimalism is all about removing distractions.

So, _stop following blindy a trend_ just because it's cool or because everyone
is using it or talking about it and start actually to find what really works for
you.  
**Don't waste too much time and money on something that is not paying back.**
